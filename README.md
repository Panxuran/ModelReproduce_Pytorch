This repository contains the pytorch code for popular deep CNN architectures and some improve for CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100/ImageNet. The reproduced models are served as baseline models in our research group. Different training techiniques are also evaluated. 

We hope this implementation and results will helpful for your research!!
